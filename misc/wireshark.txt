===== DAYTIME =====
1. TCP 3-way handshake
  1 192.168.64.2  129.6.15.28  TCP [SYN]      Seq=0 Win=64260 Len=0 MSS=1460 SACK_Perm TSv...
  2 129.6.15.28   192,168.64.2 TCP [SYN, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=65535 Len=0 MSS=1368 WS...
  3 192.168.64.2  129.6.15.28  TCP [ACK]      Seq=q Ack=1 Win=64256 Len=0
2. NC on my Kali computer uses port 52790.
3. The client needs a port so the server knows where to send the information to so it can be properly processed.
4. The fourth fram contains the date and time.

5. The full content of the frame's Daytime Protocol is as follows:
    Type: Response
    Daytime: \n60202 23-09-15 16:27:45 50 0 0 284.2 UTC(NIST) *\n
  The first number under daytime is the Modified Julian Date. The next set of numbers is the year, date, and month. The next
  numbers are the time in hours, minutes, and seconds. The next number indicates whether the US is on daylight savings time.
  The fifth number specifies whether the leap second will be added at midnight on the last day of this month. The sixth number
  indicates the health of the server and the seventh is the number of milliseconds advanced due to network delays. The following
  letters indicate that this is UTC from NIST.
6. [SYN] stands for synchronize and is used to initiate a connection between the client and the server.
7. [ACK] stands for acknowledgement and it is used to confirm that packets have been properly received.
8. [FIN] stands for finish and it is used to close a connection between the server and client.
9. The daytime server initiated the closing of the TCP connection. I know this because the daytime server sent the first [FIN]
   packet.

===== HTTP =====
1. In the initial TCP handshake there are two TCP connections established between the client and the server. I know this because
there are four [SYN] packets at the start where two client ports are connected to the port 80 of of the server in two TCP handshakes.
2. I am able to tell where index.html was requested. This is in the fifth frame which is displayed as follows:
      5 192.168.64.2  45.79.89.123 HTTP  GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
   This is clearly where the homepage is requested as the source is the client and the packet info is a GET request for the homepage.
3. I am able to tell where jeff_square_head.jpg is requested. This requested is the 11th frame which is displayed as follows:
      11 192.168.64.2 45..79.89.123 HTTP GET /jeff_square_head.jpg HTTP/1.1
  This is clearly where jeff_square_head.jpg is requested as the source is the client and the packet info is a GET request for the immage.

===== QUESTIONS =====
Would wireshark not work if your homepage used https? If it does work, then how would it differ?
What do Seq and Win mean under packet info?
